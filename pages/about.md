  bio: |
    I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/) at 
    [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). I received my B.S. degree from [Wuhan University of Technology](https://www.whut.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research focuses on geometry processing and physics-based simulation, aiming to integrate optimization methods with AI algorithms to address key challenges in 3D geometric modeling, surface mesh processing, and physically consistent simulation.

      I aim to develop hybrid geometric computing methods that integrate optimization and learning, enabling robust 3D modeling, high-quality surface/mesh processing, and physically consistent simulation. My long-term goal is to bridge geometric priors and data-driven representations to achieve scalable, reliable pipelines for engineering-oriented design and analysis.
